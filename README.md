GXUI - A Go cross platform UI library.
=======

Disclaimer
---
All code in this package **is experimental and will have frequent breaking
changes**. Please feel free to play, but please don't be upset when the API has significant reworkings.

The code is currently undocumented, and is certainly **not idiomatic Go**. It will be heavily refactored over the coming months.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.

GXUI was written by a couple of Googlers as an experiment, but with help of the open-source community GXUI could mature into something far more interesting.

Contributions, however small are extremely welcome but will require the author to have signed the [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1).

The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.
