GXUI - A Go cross platform UI library.
=======

Disclamer
---
All code in this package **is experimental and will have frequent breaking
changes**. Please feel free to play, but please don't be upset when the API has significant reworkings.

The code is currently undocumented, and is certainly **not idiomatic Go**. It will be heavily refactored over the coming months.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.

GXUI was written by a couple of Googlers as an experiement, but with help of the open-source community GXUI could mature into something far more interesting.
